# app/hub/input_focus_tracker.py

"""Focus tracking for NiceGUI numeric inputs.

NiceGUI's ``ui.number`` does NOT expose a ``is_focused`` attribute
(verified against NiceGUI 3.12.1: ``[a for a in dir(ui.number) if
'focus' in a.lower()] == []``). Without an explicit tracker, the
per-tick refresh from ``ModalChild`` / ``FaceplatePanel`` clobbers
the operator's in-progress SP/OP edits.

This helper closes the gap with a tiny, explicit focus tracker:

- ``attach_focus_tracker(field)`` wires the DOM ``focus`` / ``blur``
  events on the field to flip a transient ``_user_is_editing``
  boolean attribute on the field itself. Idempotent.
- ``is_user_editing(field)`` reads that flag — returns ``False`` if
  the field was never tracked, so refreshes still work for any
  numeric input that didn't opt in.

Used by:

- ``ControllerModal._set_field_value`` in
  ``app/hub/children/modals/base.py`` (per-tick refresh from
  :class:`ModalChild`).
- ``FaceplatePanel._sync_input_from_store`` in
  ``app/components/faceplate.py`` (the drawer's per-tick input mirror).

Runtime Manager numeric inputs (Ts / acceleration / end_time) are
NOT touched by any per-tick refresh — they commit on blur/Enter
only — so they don't need this guard.

Moved here from the legacy ``app/pid/_shared/input_focus_tracker.py``
during the v1 purge — same code, new location.
