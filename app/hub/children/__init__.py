# app/hub/children/__init__.py

"""Built-in children for :class:`app.hub.SignalHub`.

Each child is a thin :class:`Subscriber` implementing ``on_tick``.
Children NEVER call ``bridge.drain_records()`` themselves — the hub
is the single drain point. Each child exposes a small ``control``
object for child-local actions (toggles, selection, open/close)
that do NOT need to round-trip through the hub or the engine.

Data Logger and Performance Monitor are NOT children in this sense
— they are page-level renderers (``app/hub/data_logger.py``,
``app/hub/perf_monitor.py``) that consume ``hub.engine_control.bridge``
directly. They were ports of the original v1 modules and kept their
own ``ui.timer`` polling so the column-picker / export / replay
behavior stays identical.
