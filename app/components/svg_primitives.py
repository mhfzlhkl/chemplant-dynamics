# app/components/svg_primitives.py

"""Shared SVG primitives used by every case's P&ID drawing.

Both ``app.components.sthr_component`` (STHR) and
``app.components.biodiesel_component`` (biodiesel) need the same
:mod:`drawsvg` scaffolding: a ``Port`` dataclass, an ``Equipment``
base class, and a small helper for building linear gradients. They
used to duplicate this scaffolding — having one copy here means a
single point of truth for the SVG equipment hierarchy.

Pure UI: no engine, no gateway, no case-specific config. Anything
imported from this module must stay drawsvg-only.
